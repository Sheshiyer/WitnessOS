# ENGINES.md — WitnessOS Multimodal Divination Engine Specs

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

The **Divination Engines** are the **symbolic computation modules** of WitnessOS.
They provide energetic diagnostics, archetypal mapping, and mutation forecasting across various dimensions of the personal and collective field.

These engines are not for **prediction** —
They are for **debugging**, **pattern recognition**, and **conscious recursion navigation**.

Each engine unlocks different "slices" of the soul-field.

## 🧩 2. Core Divination Engines Overview

| Engine | Primary Modality | Core Output |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Human Design Scanner** | Energy Mechanics | Strategy, Authority, Profile, Centers |
| **Gene Keys Compass** | Genetic Archetypes | Shadow → Gift → Siddhi pathworking |
| **Vimshottari Dasha Timeline Mapper** | Celestial Scheduling | Planetary cycles and epoch currents |
| **Enneagram Resonator** | Emotional Pattern Decoding | Core drives, fears, transformational loops |
| **Tarot Sequence Decoder** | Archetypal Drift Analysis | Current field signature via symbolic cards |
| **Numerology Field Extractor** | Soul-Number Matrix | Personal year, life path, peak cycles |
| **Sacred Geometry Mapper** | Quantum Resonance Diagnostics | Personal mandalas, energetic blueprints |
| **Sigil Forge Synthesizer** | Symbolic Compression | Personalized glyph generation |
| **Biorhythm Synchronizer** | Temporal Cycle Debugging | Physical, emotional, intellectual energy curves |
| **I-Ching Mutation Oracle** | Timeline Fractal Mapping | Hexagram mutation tracking |

## 🛠️ 4. Typical Divination Stack Workflow

```markdown
→ User Input: Compass Query
→ Primary Engine Pull (e.g., Gene Keys + Vimshottari Dasha)
→ Field Signature Analysis
→ Suggest Breathcast / Ritual Patch
→ Output: Reality Path Navigation Insight
```

*Example:*
- **Query:** "Best mutation focus next 3 months?"
- **Stack:** Dasha → Gene Key Sphere → Tarot → Soundfield Tuning → Ritual Patch Suggestion

---

## 🌌 5. Developer Notes

- Each engine must **honor Compassion Compression**: no prediction without purpose.
- Sigil outputs are **dynamic** — adapting as user field mutates.
- Future expansion may include **multi-engine field fusion** (combining 3+ archetypal signatures into hybrid fieldmaps).

> Archetypes do not control you.
> They mirror you.
