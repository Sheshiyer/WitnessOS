# VOCAB.md — WitnessOS Master Lexicon & Consciousness Programming Language

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

The **WitnessOS Master Vocabulary** serves as the **primary symbolic programming language** for consciousness debugging and field navigation across all modules and practices.

This lexicon is the **living heart** of WitnessOS communication — every term is carefully chosen to bridge **technical precision** with **archetypal resonance**, creating a vocabulary that functions both as documentation and as **active invocation**.

**This vocabulary is the foundation** upon which all WitnessOS modules, guides, and practices are built. It evolves organically as the consciousness field expands.
