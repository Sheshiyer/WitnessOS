## 📋 **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**

_Context-aware development principles for WitnessOS Webshore_

### **🧠 Context-First Development**

1. **Before building any component** → Check existing engine implementations in
   `/src/engines/`
2. **Before defining types** → Reference Python data models for accuracy
3. **Before writing algorithms** → Check if calculation exists in engines
4. **Before naming variables** → Use consciousness terminology from `/docs/`
5. **Before API calls** → Understand engine input/output from demos

### **🎨 Consciousness Design Principles**

1. **Mystical-Technical Balance** → Maintain spiritual terminology with
   technical precision
2. **Discovery-Based UX** → Users should feel they found things themselves
3. **Procedural Generation** → Everything created algorithmically, not static
   assets
4. **Breath Synchronization** → All animations should sync to breathing patterns
5. **Sacred Geometry Foundation** → Use mathematical harmony in all visual
   elements

### **🔄 Iterative Development Flow**

1. **Research Phase** → Study existing engine + docs for context
2. **Design Phase** → Plan component with consciousness principles
3. **Build Phase** → Implement with proper TypeScript types
4. **Test Phase** → Verify against actual engine outputs
5. **Integrate Phase** → Connect to discovery mechanics
6. **Update Todo** → Mark completed and plan next section

### **📚 Required Reading Before Each Phase**

- **Phase 1-2**: `/docs/development/webshore/webshore.md` - Core architecture
- **Phase 3**: `/docs/consciousness/GUIDES/PRIMER.md` - Entry experience design
- **Phase 4**: `/src/engines/examples/discovery_game_mechanics.py` - Game
  mechanics
- **Phase 5**: All engine implementations in `/src/engines/engines/` -
  Integration patterns
- **Phase 6-8**: `/docs/development/webshore/UI-components.md` - Component
  specifications

## 🌀 **FRACTAL & GLSL INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK**

_Inspired by Yohei Nishitsuji's "Rendering the Simulation Theory" - Codrops
2025_

### **🧬 Core Fractal Philosophy**

- **"Everything is a Wave"** → All visuals sync to breath patterns and
  consciousness frequencies
- **Minimal Code, Maximum Impact** → 267-character shader challenge for Vercel
  optimization
- **Fractal Consciousness** → Self-similar patterns across all scales (micro ↔
  macro)
- **Simulation Theory** → Reality as hackable code, discoverable through
  interaction

### **🎨 Technical Implementation Principles**

1. **Wave Equation Foundation** → All animations based on mathematical wave
   functions
2. **Custom Noise Functions** → Consciousness-responsive procedural generation
3. **Fractal Zoom Portals** → Infinite depth exploration in Portal Chamber
4. **Sacred Geometry Fractals** → Golden ratio, Fibonacci, Platonic solid
   subdivisions
5. **Reality Simulation Effects** → Minimal GLSL for "glitch" and "patch"
   discoveries

### **🔮 Consciousness-Specific Adaptations**

- **Archetypal Fractals** → Each Human Design type gets unique fractal
  signatures
- **Numerology Patterns** → Life path numbers determine fractal iteration counts
- **Breath Synchronization** → Wave modulation of all fractal parameters
- **Discovery Mechanics** → Hidden patterns revealed through specific
  interactions
- **Scale Dissolution** → Zoom effects blur boundaries between layers

### **📁 Enhanced Project Structure**

### **🌊 Wave-Based Reality Framework**

- **Consciousness Frequencies** → Solfeggio (528Hz), Chakra, Planetary
  resonances
- **Breath Wave Modulation** → All visuals pulse with user's breathing rhythm
- **Field Interference** → User consciousness + archetypal energies create
  patterns
- **Fractal Recursion** → Each breath cycle reveals deeper consciousness layers
