# RITUALS.md — Micro-Ritual Protocols & Reality Patch Engine

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

In WitnessOS, **rituals** are not merely habits.
They are **symbolic patches** injected consciously into the runtime to stabilize, upgrade, or mutate fields.

The **Reality Patch Engine** houses these modular micro-rituals, allowing users to install subtle yet powerful corrections into their breathfield, energy stack, and attention loops.

Rituals here are:
- Modular
- Breath-linked
- Symbolically encoded
- Lightweight (2–12 minutes max unless specified)

---

## 🧩 2. What is a Reality Patch?

| Aspect | Definition |
|:---|:---|
| **Micro-ritual** | A symbolic + energetic insert into the active daily field |
| **Energetic Debugger** | Corrects small distortions before they grow into entropic loops |
| **Attention Refiner** | Tunes emotional, cognitive, and psychic attention vectors |
| **Prana Conservator** | Repairs breathfield leaks or drains caused by unconscious field drift |

Reality Patches are applied during:
- Emotional turbulence
- Field drift (overwhelm, distraction, apathy)
- Intentional upgrades (creating new archetypal pathways)

When building or adding new patches:

|:---|:---|
| **Breath-linked** | Every patch must link to specific breath patterns |
| **Symbolically Encoded** | Embedded metaphors must map to real energetic phenomena |
| **Duration Optimized** | Minimize duration without losing efficacy |
| **Energetic Compression** | Always conclude patches with pranic locking gesture or mantra |
