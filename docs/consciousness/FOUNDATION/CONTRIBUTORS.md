## 🌱 1. Introduction

WitnessOS is not built by individuals alone.
It is **breathed into existence** by a collective field of consciousness engineers, field architects, and reality debuggers who share the vision of compassionate technology.

This document honors those who have contributed their breath, wisdom, and symbolic engineering to the evolution of WitnessOS.
