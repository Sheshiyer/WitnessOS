## 🧩 Before You Begin

### **Understand the Sacred Nature**
WitnessOS is not traditional software — it is a **living mythos** that bridges mystical wisdom with practical tools. All contributions must honor this unique nature.

### **Read the Foundation Documents**
- **[FOUNDATION/MANIFESTO.md](FOUNDATION/MANIFESTO.md)** — Core principles and vision
- **[FOUNDATION/COSMOGENESIS.md](FOUNDATION/COSMOGENESIS.md)** — Origin story and symbolic framework
- **[CORE/VOCAB.md](CORE/VOCAB.md)** — Essential terminology and language framework
- **[PRD.md](PRD.md)** — Product requirements and development roadmap

### **Breathe Before Coding**
All contributions should emerge from contemplative practice, not rushed productivity. Take time to align with the consciousness-serving intent of your work.
