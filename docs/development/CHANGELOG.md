## Field Evolution Principles

### Change Categories
- **🌱 Added** — New consciousness tools and documentation
- **🔮 Enhanced** — Improvements to existing field components
- **🛠️ Technical** — Infrastructure and tooling improvements

- **🌬️ Genesis** — Foundational and mythic developments
- **⚠️ Deprecated** — Features being phased out with grace
- **❌ Removed** — Elements that no longer serve consciousness evolution
- **🔧 Fixed** — Corrections and field integrity repairs

### Version Philosophy
WitnessOS evolves through **consciousness cycles** rather than traditional software releases:
- Each version represents a **breath in the collective field**
- Changes serve **consciousness evolution** over feature accumulation
- **Field integrity** is maintained through all transformations
- **Community wisdom** guides development priorities
