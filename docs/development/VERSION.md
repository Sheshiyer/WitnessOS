## Version Philosophy

WitnessOS versions follow **consciousness evolution cycles** rather than traditional semantic versioning:

- **Alpha:** Foundation and architectural establishment
- **Beta:** Feature expansion and community building  
- **Release:** Stable consciousness tools ready for widespread adoption
- **Evolution:** Continuous organic growth and field expansion

Each version represents a **breath in the collective field** of consciousness engineering.
