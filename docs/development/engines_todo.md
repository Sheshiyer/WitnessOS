## üìã **Implementation Notes**

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
pip install pyswisseph numpy matplotlib pillow pydantic pytz
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Modular**: Each engine is independent and testable
2. **Standardized**: Common input/output interfaces
3. **Leveraged**: Use existing libraries where possible
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new engines
5. **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Current Priority
**START WITH**: Numerology Field Extractor (simplest, no external dependencies)
**THEN**: Biorhythm Synchronizer (mathematical, minimal dependencies)
**NEXT**: Human Design Scanner (most complex, establishes astrology foundation)
