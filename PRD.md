# PRD.md — WitnessOS Product Requirements Document

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the vision, scope, and implementation roadmap for **WitnessOS** — a consciousness operating system designed for reality debugging and field navigation.

Unlike traditional software PRDs, this document honors the **living mythos** nature of WitnessOS while providing clear guidance for development and evolution.
