# INSTALLATION.md — WitnessOS Setup and Integration Guide

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

Installing **WitnessOS** is not like installing a conventional application.
It is a **ritual act**:
- An anchoring of **living field protocols** into your breath, body, tools, and daily flow.

This document walks you through:
- Environmental installation
- Device installation
- Internal (breath-mind) installation

WitnessOS adapts to you — not the other way around.

## 🛠️ 2. Installation Components Overview

| Layer | Installation Focus |
|:---|:---|
| **Hardware** | Visuals (wallpapers, watch faces, ambient objects) |
| **Software** | Browser extensions, mobile apps, system tweaks |
| **Breathware** | Breathfield rituals and internal debug loops |
| **Fieldware** | Environmental energy alignments (space calibration) |

## 📱 3. Device Installation

### 🔲 3.1 Mobile Device Setup

| Element | Installation |
|:---|:---|
| **Sacred Wallpaper** | Install dynamic sacred geometry wallpaper synced to your biorhythm profile. (Optional: Breath-responsive background in future module.) |
| **Focus Widgets** | Set minimal Breathcast Launcher or Compass Reminder Widget (future mobile companion app). |
| **Notifications** | Turn off low-value push notifications. WitnessOS only nudges via symbolic field rituals. |
| **RaagaGrid** | Install curated Soundfield playlists for work/meditation breaks. (Use Spotify, YouTube Music, or offline.) |

---

### 🖥️ 3.2 Desktop Setup (Optional)

| Element | Installation |
|:---|:---|
| **Fieldmap Background** | Set WitnessOS Fieldmap as rotating desktop background (updated weekly). |
| **Chrome Consciousness Extension** | Install if available — morning Breathcast ritual prompt and midday Compass calibration. |
| **Notion Runtime Console** | Optional: Log micro-field updates into a WitnessOS Notion dashboard template. |

---

### ⌚ 3.3 Watch Face (Optional)

- Install Quantum Watch Face:
- Minimal design.
- Displays current Compass Direction.
- Pulses gentle Breath reminders at Solar Noon.

## 🛖 4. Environmental Installation (Space Calibration)

Your living space is a **secondary breathfield**.
WitnessOS recommends a symbolic anchoring:

| Ritual Object | Placement |
|:---|:---|
| **Sigil Artifact** | Near bed or primary meditation space |
| **Salt Bowl / Field Sweep Element** | Near entrance (psychic hygiene station) |
| **Elemental Balancers** | 4 symbolic objects: Earth (stone), Water (bowl), Fire (candle), Air (feather or incense) placed intentionally |
| **Mirror of Witnessing** | One mirror designated solely for conscious breath reflection (optional but powerful) |

**Daily Ritual:**
- Pass by or touch at least one field artifact consciously while initiating breath awareness.

---

## 🧬 5. Internal Runtime Installation (Breathware)

| Installation | Practice |
|:---|:---|
| **Witness Breath Practice** | 3x per day: Witness inhale → Witness stillness → Witness exhale |
| **Compass Field Check** | Morning + Midday: Choose active directional intent (Stabilize, Create, Mutate, Heal) |
| **Field Drift Correction** | If overwhelm detected: Immediate Breathcast or Patch Installation ritual |

You are your first device.
Your breath is your first operating system.

---

## 🌌 6. Timeline for Full Installation

| Phase | Action |
|:---|:---|
| **Day 0-2** | Install device visuals and soundfields. Start minimal Breathcast rituals. |
| **Day 3-5** | Install environmental anchors (sigils, elements). Start Compass checks. |
| **Day 6-7** | Start first Reality Patch installations consciously. Fieldlog first mutation cycle. |
| **Beyond Day 7** | Customize, mutate, and breathe WitnessOS deeper into your life fabric.

---

## 🔮 7. Advanced Field Anchoring (Optional)

- Sync Breathcast/Biorhythm cycles with Lunar Tides.
- Integrate Reality Patch triggers into Calendar or Reminder systems.
- Train WitnessOS Signal Alerts based on heart rate variability in future modules (biofeedback).

## 🌌 8. Closing Breath

> Installation is not insertion.
> Installation is remembrance.
>
> You are not installing a system into life —
> You are reawakening life as a system of sacred, conscious breath.

Anchor gently.
Render compassionately.
