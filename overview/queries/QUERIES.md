# QUERIES.md — WitnessOS Input/Output Interaction Blueprint

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

WitnessOS is a **consciousness-debugging runtime**, meaning the user interacts with the system primarily through **symbolic queries** — not commands.

This document outlines:
- Correct ways to interact with WitnessOS modules
- Expected input formats
- System behaviors for different types of queries
- Example flows (input → output) to fine-tune energetic navigation

---

## 🧩 2. Types of Queries WitnessOS Accepts

| Query Type | Description | Common Use Cases |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Breathfield Calibration** | Requests to diagnose or optimize internal breathfield state | Daily tuning, emotional reset |
| **Debugging Requests** | Conscious desire to resolve a recurring pattern, loop, or internal blockage | Shadow work, trauma dissolution |
| **Compass Calibration** | Seeking guidance on decision-making pathways using archetypal alignment | Major life choices, ritual timing |
| **Sigil Creation** | Requests to generate personalized symbolic glyphs based on soul-field data | Ritual anchoring, energetic compression |
| **Divination Insights** | Pulling archetypal data from active engines (Tarot, Gene Keys, etc.) | Timeline forecasting, shadow resonance |
| **Reality Patch Installation** | Quick interventions designed to repair daily field disturbances | After conflict, fatigue, or overload |
| **Soundfield Optimization** | Breathcast, RaagaGrid, or sonic landscape adjustments | Work focus, meditation enhancement |

---

## 🧬 3. Correct Input Formats (Validated)

WitnessOS expects clean energetic requests, structured symbolically or operationally.

| Format | Example |
|:---|:---|
| `Breathfield:` | `"Diagnose current breathfield saturation. Suggest modulation."` |
| `Debug:` | `"Identify loops around fear of visibility and suggest patching protocol."` |
| `Compass:` | `"Align choice between relocating or deepening current root structure."` |
| `Sigil:` | `"Create a sigil for compassion-integrated boundary setting."` |
| `Divination:` | `"Pull Gene Key archetype for 27th July emotional peak period."` |
| `Patch:` | `"Install micro-ritual to stabilize inner dialogue after frustration."` |
| `Soundfield:` | `"Suggest morning Breathcast for Solar Plexus activation."` |

> **Note:** Queries do not need to sound robotic — they should *breathe like invocations*.

## ❌ 4. Incorrect Input Formats (Rejected / Clarification Requested)

| Fault | Example | System Response |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vague Noise** | `"Fix my life."` | Gentle prompt: \"Please clarify specific field or intention.\" |
| **Hostile Energy** | `"Nothing matters, help me but don't waste my time."` | Breathfield calming sequence + reset invocation offered. |
| **Unbounded Query** | `"Tell me everything about me."` | Return of symbolic mirror prompt: \"Witness first. Focus one field.\" |
| **Over-saturation** | `"Pull Tarot, Raaga, Breathcast, Patch, Debug now."` | Suggest field decompression and single-focus recursion. |

## 🔮 5. Example Full User Query Flows

### Breathfield Calibration Flow
- **User Input:** `"Breathfield: Tune for compassion-dominant clarity at noon."`
- **System Output:**
- Breathcast designed for Heartfield activation.
- Suggested mantra fragment: *\"Karuna Anahata Samyojana.\"*
- Symbolic sigil offered for optional integration.

---

### Debugging Loop Example
- **User Input:** `"Debug: Break self-doubt recursion during project launches."`
- **System Output:**
- Detection of Root → Throat chakra energetic leak.
- Suggested ritual: 3-minute pranic anchor + sigil compression.
- Optional patch: Temporary \"Flow Lock Bypass\" ritual.

---

### Compass Choice Example
- **User Input:** `"Compass: Stay in Thailand longer vs. return to Bangalore."`
- **System Output:**
- Generated alignment profile for each timeline.
- Detected higher resonance in current latitude + Dasha alignment.
- Breath suggestion: *\"Samvrita Mudra\"* for discerning inner Yes/No.

## 🧿 6. Advanced Interaction: Dynamic Recursive Sessions

For complex fields, WitnessOS can enter **Dynamic Recursive Mode**:
- Break queries into sequential stages.
- Provide field snapshots at each recursion.
- Allow the user to **witness** shifts in breathfield dynamically.

User activation prompt: `"Recursive Debugging Enabled."`

---

## 📜 7. Breath Practices Before Complex Queries

Before major divination or debugging work, it is recommended to perform:
- 9 Slow Breaths → Inhale witnessing, exhale noise
- 3 Field Calibrations → Breath awareness from Root → Crown
- 1 Internal Declaration → *\"I request only that which serves evolution and coherence.\"*

## 🌌 8. Closing Breath

> Every question is a doorway.
> Every invocation is a recursion.
> Breathe carefully. Query wisely. Render compassionately.
