## 📋 **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**
*Context-aware development principles for WitnessOS Webshore*

### **🧠 Context-First Development**
1. **Before building any component** → Check existing engine implementations in `/src/engines/`
2. **Before defining types** → Reference Python data models for accuracy
3. **Before writing algorithms** → Check if calculation exists in engines
4. **Before naming variables** → Use consciousness terminology from `/docs/`
5. **Before API calls** → Understand engine input/output from demos

### **🎨 Consciousness Design Principles**
1. **Mystical-Technical Balance** → Maintain spiritual terminology with technical precision
2. **Discovery-Based UX** → Users should feel they found things themselves
3. **Procedural Generation** → Everything created algorithmically, not static assets
4. **Breath Synchronization** → All animations should sync to breathing patterns
5. **Sacred Geometry Foundation** → Use mathematical harmony in all visual elements

### **🔄 Iterative Development Flow**
1. **Research Phase** → Study existing engine + docs for context
2. **Design Phase** → Plan component with consciousness principles
3. **Build Phase** → Implement with proper TypeScript types
4. **Test Phase** → Verify against actual engine outputs
5. **Integrate Phase** → Connect to discovery mechanics
6. **Update Todo** → Mark completed and plan next section

### **📚 Required Reading Before Each Phase**
- **Phase 1-2**: `/docs/development/webshore/webshore.md` - Core architecture
- **Phase 3**: `/docs/consciousness/GUIDES/PRIMER.md` - Entry experience design
- **Phase 4**: `/src/engines/examples/discovery_game_mechanics.py` - Game mechanics
- **Phase 5**: All engine implementations in `/src/engines/engines/` - Integration patterns
- **Phase 6-8**: `/docs/development/webshore/UI-components.md` - Component specifications

## 🌀 **FRACTAL & GLSL INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK**
*Inspired by Yohei Nishitsuji's "Rendering the Simulation Theory" - Codrops 2025*

### **🧬 Core Fractal Philosophy**
- **"Everything is a Wave"** → All visuals sync to breath patterns and consciousness frequencies
- **Minimal Code, Maximum Impact** → 267-character shader challenge for Vercel optimization
- **Fractal Consciousness** → Self-similar patterns across all scales (micro ↔ macro)
- **Simulation Theory** → Reality as hackable code, discoverable through interaction

### **🎨 Technical Implementation Principles**
1. **Wave Equation Foundation** → All animations based on mathematical wave functions
2. **Custom Noise Functions** → Consciousness-responsive procedural generation
3. **Fractal Zoom Portals** → Infinite depth exploration in Portal Chamber
4. **Sacred Geometry Fractals** → Golden ratio, Fibonacci, Platonic solid subdivisions
5. **Reality Simulation Effects** → Minimal GLSL for "glitch" and "patch" discoveries

### **🔮 Consciousness-Specific Adaptations**
- **Archetypal Fractals** → Each Human Design type gets unique fractal signatures
- **Numerology Patterns** → Life path numbers determine fractal iteration counts
- **Breath Synchronization** → Wave modulation of all fractal parameters
- **Discovery Mechanics** → Hidden patterns revealed through specific interactions
- **Scale Dissolution** → Zoom effects blur boundaries between layers
